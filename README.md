# XML Data Preprocessing for Book Reviews Analysis
## Overview

This project involves preprocessing XML datasets for content analysis of book reviews. The script included in this notebook is designed to extract and analyze information from XML files, preparing the data for subsequent steps in a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline.

## Features

**Data Extraction:** Unzips and loads XML files from the provided datasets.

**XML Parsing:** Utilizes the xml.etree.ElementTree library to parse XML files and extract relevant elements.

**Content Inspection:** Iterates over specific XML tags (e.g., descriptorname, meshheading) to extract and print information for further analysis.

## Usage

To use this script:

Ensure that your XML datasets (trainset.zip and devtestset.zip) are available.
Run the notebook to unzip and parse the XML files.
The extracted data will be printed for inspection and further processing.

## Requirements

· Python 3.x  
· xml.etree.ElementTree library (part of the Python Standard Library)  

This script serves as an essential step in preparing XML-based book review data for NLP tasks such as clustering and content analysis.
